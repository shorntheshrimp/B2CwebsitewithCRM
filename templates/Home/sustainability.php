		        	<p class="pera">This all started from a couple of university students with the premise of inexpensive projects. What begun as a casual hobby transformed into a passion for crafting. One day, one of us said, "It's a pity no-one would ever know about this...". <br>The cogs started turning, and before we knew it, here we are.</p>
